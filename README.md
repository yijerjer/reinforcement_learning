# Reinforcement Learning Notes and Solution to Exercises
### Using the [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction, Second Edition by Sutton and Barto](http://www.incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html). Code is written in C++ and Python.

* There is a `.pdf` in each chapter which contains the general notes of the chapter, as well as attempts to answer the exercises provided in the book. 
* For coding exercises, the outputs are usually stored in a `csvs/` subdirectory as `.csv` files. Thus, running the python code should immediately yield the relevant graphs. The C++ files should also work out of the box, and variants of the code can be obtained by tweaking the parameters to the classes.
